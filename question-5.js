What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer:
the Big O is an O(n**2) since it is double for loops. the amount of loop increases by the number of data powered by the amount of for loop.
If we plot a graph from loops occuring during the execution, the graph turns out exponential pattern.
But bubble sort can be both O(n) and O(log(n)). If the data is sorted well or closer to be well-sorted, it goes O(n).
On the contrary, if the data is not sorted, then it goes O(n**2)
